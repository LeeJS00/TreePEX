## 1. Goal

* Cut per-design **shared feature build wall time** (PDK + DEF + V3 + V4)
  by **≥ 5 ×** on nova while keeping cold-start MAPE within +0.2 pp on
  `tot` AND +0.3 pp on per-channel `cpl` of the current numbers (TreePEX
  nova 5.54 % / tv80s 5.10 % tot; gnd / cpl bounds in §6).
* Target wall budgets (16 worker fork-Pool, gpu-8):
  * tv80s: 162 s → **≤ 30 s** (Round 1), **≤ 8 s** (Round 2 GPU)
  * nova:  8,050 s → **≤ 1,800 s** (Round 1, ~25 min), **≤ 200 s** (Round 2 GPU)

## 2. Current bottleneck breakdown (from `COLD_START_REPORT.md` §3.2)

| Stage | tv80s (s) | nova (s) | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| PDK parse | 0.77 | 0.39 | one-time; negligible. **No work needed.** |
| DEF parse | 3.96 | 93.67 | streaming parser, single-thread. **Maybe.** |
| V3 features (41-D) | **69.79** | **5,607.13** | **bottleneck (nova).** |
| V4 H3 features (26-D, tile cache) | 87.65 | 2,348.97 | **2nd bottleneck.** |
| Inference + SPEF | 1.8 – 187 | 1.0 – 2,277 | model-specific, not in this scope. |

## 3. Root-cause analysis

### 3.1 V3 features (nova: 93 min)

`_v3_per_net(net_name)` (in `pex_cold.py:251`) for each of 118,959 nets:

1. SpatialGrid query → candidate aggressor cuboid set (size *N_c*).
2. Numpy broadcast distance matrix: `(N_t × N_c)` for target with *N_t* cuboids
   (lines 294-303).
3. Per-aggressor closest-pair aggregation (Python dict loop, lines 326-349).
4. `compact_gnd_estimate_fF` — Python `for i in range(n)` loop over the
   full target_arr (lines 436-444), independent of subsampling.
5. Edge stats / VSS shield / compact priors.

**Pathology**: long-tail nets where *N_t* and *N_c* are both large (clock
spines, reset nets, top-level signals in nova). Memory and CPU scale
O(N_t · N_c). A 2k-cuboid clock spine with 20k candidates → 40 M-pair
float matrix per net ≈ 320 MB transient + 40 M sqrt/cmp ops. With 16
workers, peak host memory can spike to ~5 GB. nova has dozens of such nets
and chunksize=64 (line 685) serializes them onto individual workers.

### 3.2 V4 H3 features (nova: 39 min)

`_v4_process_net((net_name, tile_paths))` (line 579):

1. For each of *T_n* tile pkl.gz files for this net, gzip-decompress + unpickle.
2. Concatenate `target_chunks` + `agg_groups`.
3. Compute pairwise top-K stats (full broadcast, lines 526-541).

**Pathology**: nova has 446 K tiles total (mean ~4 tiles / net), stored as
individual `.pkl.gz` files in a flat per-design directory
(`/data/PINNPEX/data/processed_v3/intel22/<design>/*.pkl.gz`). Each pkl.gz
is ~40-100 KB. Even at 10 ms per tile load that's 75 min wall on 1 worker.
At 16 workers it's I/O- and decompress-bound on local NVMe.

> **Plan-vs-disk note**: an earlier draft assumed
> `per_net_cuboids/*.npz` already exists "for mesh-PINN" — disk reality
> shows only `<design>_map.csv` and `<design>_net_mapping.csv` at the
> design level. Any per-net or per-design pre-aggregation is a **new**
> asset to build, not a reuse.

## 4. Proposed approaches (ranked by expected impact / engineering cost)

### 4.1 V3 features

| # | Approach | Expected gain (nova V3) | Effort | Risk |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| V3-A | **Target-cuboid sub-sampling for the broadcast only** at *N_t* = 256 (mirrors V4's `MAX_TARGET_CUBS_V4`). **Sum / scalar features (`n_cuboids`, `total_wire_length_um`, `total_metal_area_um2`, bbox stats, `layer_hist`, `density_*`, `compact_gnd_estimate_fF`) MUST be computed on the full target_arr.** Only the `(N_t × N_c)` distance broadcast (pex_cold.py:294-303) and the closest-pair dict loop see the subsampled rows. Subsample with a deterministic per-net seed: `np.random.RandomState(hash(net_name) & 0xFFFFFFFF)`. | **5 – 10 ×** | low | small accuracy drift if very large nets dominate; verify on training designs first. |
| V3-A' | **Vectorize `compact_gnd_estimate_fF`** (pex_cold.py:436-444): replace Python loop with NumPy. Free win, independent of V3-A. | 1.1 – 1.3 × additive | trivial | none — pure refactor, identical output. |
| V3-B | **Aggressor cap per net** *N_c* ≤ 4096 before broadcast, ranking candidates by **bbox-edge distance to target bbox** (NOT centroid: elongated nets such as clock spines have periphery aggressors that centroid ranking would miss). Use `max(0, |cx − tcx| − (cw + tbw)/2)`-style metric per axis. | 2 – 4 × | low | over-cap may drop weak couplings, slightly bias `n_aggressor_nets`. |
| V3-C | **`chunksize=1` for `imap_unordered`** + dispatch-by-size sort (largest nets first) in BOTH `extract_v3_features` (pex_cold.py:685) and `extract_v4_h3_from_tile_cache` (line 715). Eliminates long-tail straggler. | 1.2 – 1.5 × additive | trivial | none. |
| V3-D | **Move broadcast to numba/cython** or use `scipy.spatial.cKDTree.query_ball_tree` for cutoff-bounded pair enumeration. **Caveat**: cKDTree is point-based; the V3 metric is bbox-edge with `w/2, h/2` dilation. Need bounding-radius dilation by `max_w/2, max_h/2`. Plan-original "medium" effort is understated. | 3 – 5 × | medium-high | introduces dep; verify correctness on canonical net. |
| V3-E | **Re-use V4 H3 candidate set** (already computed downstream) instead of running V3 SpatialGrid query separately. Both stages query the same neighborhood. | 1.5 × | medium | pipeline restructuring; absorbed into §4.3 G if Round 2 lands. |
| V3-F | **C++ extension** for `_enumerate_coupling_edges`. | 10 × | high | last-resort. |

### 4.2 V4 H3 features

| # | Approach | Expected gain (nova V4) | Effort | Risk |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| V4-A | **Pre-aggregate to per-net npz** (one file per net) so V4 inference becomes one numpy load + per-net loop. Eliminates 446 K gzip+pickle calls. **Schema is new** — existing mesh-PINN per-net assets (if any) contain only `target_cubs[N,10]`; V4 needs `(target_cubs, dict[agg_name → agg_cubs])`. | **10 – 20 ×** | low-medium | new schema; absorbed into §4.3 G if Round 2 lands. |
| V4-B | **mmap'd tile cache** (uncompressed npy) instead of gzip pkl. | 3 – 5 × | medium | requires rebuilding cache; doubles disk usage. |
| V4-C | **Lazy / streaming aggregation** in `pex_cold.py` itself: read tile pkl.gz once, emit V3 + V4 simultaneously. | 1.5 – 2 × | medium | non-trivial refactor; needs tile-cache during V3. |
| V4-D | **Drop V4 H3** entirely for cold-start, retrain TreePEX on 41-D only. | infinite (V4 = 0) | high | model retrain + 5-seed; expected accuracy hit +0.5-1 pp based on B1 result. |

### 4.3 Tensor + GPU axis (added 2026-05-13)

Environment: 8× NVIDIA RTX A6000 (48 GB each, idle), torch 2.4.0+cu121,
xgboost 3.2.0 (supports `device='cuda'` predict). Current CSV/pkl.gz
storage and numpy per-net broadcast leave ~400 GB of GPU RAM unused.

| # | Approach | Expected gain (nova V3+V4 combined) | Effort | Risk |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| G | **Per-design tensor asset** (`<design>_cuboids.pt`): single `torch.save` containing `all_cuboids[N,10]` fp32, `owner_id[N]` int32 (integer not string — string is RAM + serialization hostile), and a CSR-style `(net_offsets, net_ids)`. nova size ~ 376 MB cuboid tensor + 38 MB owner + < 100 MB index ≈ **< 1 GB per design vs. 446 K pkl.gz files**. Load with `torch.load(..., mmap=True)` for zero-copy lazy access. Replaces V4-A (and V3-E folds in for free: V3 reads the same asset). | rebuild-once asset; runtime gain comes from B | medium (one build_dataset extension) | new schema; one-time disk rebuild ~tens of minutes per design. |
| B | **Batched torch+GPU broadcast** for V3 (pex_cold.py:294-303) and V4 (pex_cold.py:526-541). Per-net GPU calls have prohibitive PCIe overhead → batch by **pair budget** (e.g. ~500 M pairs ≈ 8-12 GB VRAM with fp32 × 4-6 tensors). Long-tail large nets routed to GPU; small nets stay on CPU (hybrid path, first-cut). Subsequent escalation: global sparse adjacency + `torch.scatter_add` per-net on a single A6000. | **20 – 80 ×** on V3 + V4 combined | medium-high | requires asset G; PCIe overhead; CUDA-fork incompat (see C below). |
| C-arch | **fork-Pool + CUDA are incompatible** (pex_cold.py:1039, `mp.set_start_method("fork")` breaks CUDA context in workers). Three options:<br/>(a) `spawn` — slow init, loses copy-on-write of geo dict.<br/>(b) Single-process, multi-GPU shard over the 8× A6000 via `torch.cuda.set_device`.<br/>(c) Hybrid — keep fork-Pool for small nets on CPU; route long-tail nets to one (or a few) single-GPU subprocesses started with spawn. | enables B | medium | risk of host-RAM duplication when spawn is used. |
| D-pred | **XGBoost GPU predict** (`device='cuda'` on the 5-seed ensemble). nova current inference 2.7 s → ~0.5 s. **Deferred — not bottleneck.** | < 5 s wall | trivial | none. |
| F | **`torch.compile` / Triton kernel** for the bbox-edge distance metric + scatter aggregation. Only revisit if naive torch in B leaves > 50 % headroom unexplored. | 2 – 3 × on top of B | high | premature; profile first. |

### 4.4 DEF parse (nova: 94 s)

Not in top-2 bottleneck but still meaningful for tv80s end-to-end:

| # | Approach | Expected gain | Effort |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| DEF-A | Cache parsed DEF as pkl per-design after first read; skip re-parse on subsequent feature regeneration. | 50 × for warm reruns | trivial |
| DEF-B | Switch to a multi-threaded LEF/DEF parser (e.g., `lefdef` C++ binding). | 5 × | high |

## 5. Recommended sequence

### Round 0 — profiling gate (DONE 2026-05-13)

Script: `TreePEX/scripts/profile_single_net.py`. Outputs at
`TreePEX/outputs/cold_reports/profile_intel22_{tv80s,nova}_f3.json`.

Findings (single-process, no Pool):

| Design | Net | N_t | N_c | wall (s) | broadcast share | pair MB |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| tv80s | CTS_2 | 1,110 | 52,662 | 3.17 | 99 % | 446 |
| tv80s | CTS_5 | 943 | 67,181 | 3.74 | 99 % | 483 |
| nova  | CTS_330 | 1,257 | 119,302 | 10.69 | 100 % | **1,144** |
| nova  | CTS_326 | 1,234 | 113,245 | 8.67 | 99 % | 1,066 |

Decisions locked from Round 0 data:
* **Broadcast dominates absolutely (99-100 %)** — every other V3 stage
  (scalar, grid query, owner filter, dict aggregation) is < 0.1 % combined.
* **V3-A alone is insufficient**: capping N_t to 256 yields ~4-5×
  reduction; N_c is the long-tail driver (nova reaches 119k candidates).
  V3-A + V3-B combined target a ~55-145× pair-count reduction.
* **V3-A' (compact_gnd vectorization) is dead code**: every profiled net
  shows `t_compact_gnd_loop < 1 ms`. Drop from Round 1.
* **V4 tile load + broadcast are co-equal** (50/50 split, concat < 2 %).
  Tile-load reduction (V4-A → Round 2 §4.3 G) and broadcast acceleration
  must both move for V4 to drop substantially.

### Round 1 — CPU/numpy speedup (LOCKED 2026-05-13 on tv80s)

**Final patch contents**:
1. **V3-A** (`MAX_TARGET_CUBS_V3 = 512`) — broadcast-only target-cuboid
   sub-sampling, deterministic per-net seed = `hash(net_name) & 0xFFFFFFFF`.
   Sum / scalar features (n_cuboids, total_wire_length, bbox, layer_hist,
   density_*, eps_*, compact_gnd) stay on full `target_arr`.
2. **V3-C** (size-sorted dispatch + `chunksize=1`) — applied to both
   `extract_v3_features` and `extract_v4_h3_from_tile_cache` Pool loops.

DROPPED (post-validation):
* **V3-A'** (compact_gnd vectorize) — Round 0 measured < 1 ms loop on all
  nets; dead code.
* **V3-B** (aggressor cand cap 4096) — first iteration measured
  `n_aggressor_nets` / `fanout` (cpl XGBoost feature_importance 0.81)
  collapsing to R² = **−5.72**, MAE 138 / mean 733. Count-based candidate
  cap drops entire aggressor net identities at the tail.
* **V3-D'** (cKDTree pre-filter + vectorized refinement) — implemented
  and benchmarked; **made V3 6.5× SLOWER** (45.8 s → 295.5 s on tv80s
  120-net dump). Root cause: per-net `sparse_distance_matrix` returns
  millions of centroid-within-(CUTOFF + max_half_diag)-pairs because of
  large-cuboid dilation, and the lexsort tail dominates the saved FLOPs.
  Saved in plan as a Round-3 footnote for a per-pair-size-bucketed retry.

**Measured outcome (tv80s, dev/validate cycle complete)**:

| Metric | Baseline (plan §2) | Patched | Δ |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| pipeline wall | 169.47 s | **78.95 s** | **2.15 ×** |
| V3 features | 69.79 s | 16.55 s | 4.22 × |
| V4 H3 features | 87.65 s | 56.27 s | 1.56 × |
| MAPE_tot | 5.105 % | 5.107 % | +0.002 pp ✅ |
| MAPE_gnd | 17.63 % | 17.63 % | 0.00 pp ✅ |
| MAPE_cpl | 13.88 % | 13.88 % | 0.00 pp ✅ |
| R²_tot | 0.992 | 0.992 | = ✅ |

**Per-feature drift** (top:20 + sample:100, deterministic seed 2026):
27/41 V3 features bit-exact (MAE = 0); remaining 14 stochastic features
all R² ≥ 0.977 (most ≥ 0.99). All 26 V4 features bit-exact (kernel
unchanged). Diff report:
`TreePEX/outputs/cold_reports/diff_intel22_tv80s_f3_v3a512.md`.

**Key finding — V3-C is the real hero on tv80s**: with V3-A disabled,
pipeline still drops to 77.8 s — virtually all of the 2.15× gain comes
from size-sorted dispatch + `chunksize=1` killing the straggler tail
across 16 Pool workers. V3-A=512 only meaningfully clips the top ~20
nets and contributes < 1 % to the wall reduction here. **V3-A's value
will only materialize on nova**, where N_t reaches 1257 (vs tv80s 1110)
and a 2-3× per-tail-net reduction matters across more long-tail nets.

**Nova promotion outcome (measured 2026-05-13)**:

| Metric | Baseline | Patched | Δ |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| pipeline wall | 8,059.16 s | **7,181.98 s** | **1.12 × (−10.9 %)** |
| V3 features | 5,607.13 s | 4,870.86 s | 1.15 × |
| V4 H3 features | 2,348.97 s | 2,207.47 s | 1.06 × |
| MAPE_tot | 5.5385 % | 5.541 % | +0.003 pp ✅ |
| MAPE_gnd | 15.8547 % | 15.86 % | +0.01 pp ✅ |
| MAPE_cpl | 15.9372 % | 15.96 % | +0.02 pp ✅ |
| R²_tot | 0.9867 | 0.9865 | −0.0002 ✅ |

**All MAPE gates pass on nova.** Wall reduction (11 %) is much weaker
than tv80s (53 %) for two structural reasons:
1. V3-A=512 rarely triggers on nova — most of 118,959 nets have
   N_t ≪ 512. The cap only clips the top few hundred nets.
2. V3-C still gives a 13 % V3 speedup, but with 118 k tasks the
   `chunksize=1` IPC overhead was prohibitive (first try: V3 stuck
   past 60 min before kill). Adaptive `chunksize = max(1, total // (n_workers
   * 1000))` solved this — small designs (tv80s 3.4 k nets) still get
   `chunksize=1`, large designs (nova 119 k nets) get `chunksize=7`.

**Implication**: Round 1 hits the §6 MAPE gate on nova but misses the
§1 wall gate (1,800 s) by 4× and the §8 Round-2 target (200 s) by 36×.
**Round 2 (per-design `.pt` asset + batched GPU broadcast) is the only
remaining path** to materially reduce nova V3+V4 from this floor.

V4 progress curve revealed an additional Round-2 lever: tile-load
dominates the long-tail nets (113 k V4 jobs × 1-5 tiles each = ~250 k
gzip+pickle reads) — V4-A (per-net pre-aggregation) would eliminate
this entirely with no accuracy risk.

### Round 2 — Tensor asset + GPU broadcast (FIRST-CUT TRIED 2026-05-13)

Two paths attempted; both deliver tv80s wins but break on nova scale.
Recorded below so the next iteration starts from measured ground truth.

#### 2.1 V4-A indexed per-design cache (`build_v4_pernet_cache.py`)

Schema v4 saves the design's full tile-aggregated cuboid arrays as NPY
files + a flat CSR per net (tile_set from `_map.csv`). Bit-exact V4
features.

| Design | Disk | Build wall | V4 wall (old → new) | Pipeline (old → new) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| tv80s | 5.7 GB | 45 s | 56.3 → 37.7 s (1.49 ×) | 78.9 → **57.9 s** (1.36 ×) |
| nova  | ~230 GB est | killed mid-sort | – | – |

* tv80s V4 features: **26/26 bit-exact** (R²=1.0, MAE=0) vs baseline.
* nova fails: `cubs[N_total=5.07 B, 10] fp32` ≈ 200 GB just for the
  cuboid array, plus argsort scratch (~40 GB) and disk write. Schema v4
  is structurally fine but I/O bound at nova scale.
* **Open**: schema v5 idea — store only per-tile bbox metadata (~50 MB)
  and recompute tile-aggregated subsets at read time from DEF cuboids
  + SpatialGrid. Needs correctness validation against the tile pkl.gz
  contents because the original training-time tile rule may differ.

#### 2.2 V3 GPU broadcast (`_v3_compute_closest_gpu`)

torch + CUDA replacement for the (N_t × N_c) numpy broadcast inside
`_v3_per_net`. Single-process loop (fork-Pool + CUDA are mutually
exclusive). `--v3-gpu` CLI flag in `pex_cold.py`.

| Design | V3 wall (CPU 16-worker → GPU 1-proc) | Pipeline | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| tv80s | 16.5 → 27.0 s (regress 1.6 ×) | 71.3 s | per-net launch + transfer overhead dominates |
| nova  | 4,871 → ETA ~11 k s (regress 2.3 ×) | killed | same overhead, but 118 K nets amplify it |

* tv80s feature drift: V3 R² ≥ 0.976 (fp32 GPU + V3-A=512 combined).
  MAPE_tot 5.086 % (within ±0.2 pp gate). 26/26 V4 features bit-exact.
* **Root cause**: 100 MB-class `cand_arr` is transferred fresh to GPU
  per net, plus Python/torch dispatch overhead is ~5-10 ms per call.
  GPU kernel itself is microseconds. With 118 K small-to-medium nets,
  per-call overhead dominates.
* **Open paths for next iteration**:
  * Pre-load `_V3_ALL_CUBS` to GPU once and gather by `cand_idx` (saves
    bandwidth per call but not dispatch).
  * Batch N nets per GPU launch via block-diagonal or per-segment masks.
  * Hybrid: keep CPU multi-proc as base, route only the top-K nets
    (where compute > overhead) to a spawn-based GPU sidecar.

#### 2.2 + V4-A combined (tv80s only)

When both are on, tv80s pipeline is **71.3 s** (vs Round 1 78 s) — the
V4-A win is real, the V3 GPU regression cancels much of it. Not yet a
clean Pareto improvement.

### Round 2.1b — V4-A schema-v5 correctness probe (FAILED 2026-05-13)

Idea: store only per-tile origin metadata (~10 MB total) and recompute
tile-aggregated cuboid sets on the fly from DEF cuboids + a 14 µm xy
bbox query around each origin. Probe script `TreePEX/scripts/_v5_verify.py`.

Verdict: **bbox query does NOT reproduce tile pkl.gz contents**. The
training-time tile builder clips DEF cuboids to the 14 µm window (a
single 50 µm wire becomes 14 µm-clipped tile pieces, one per overlap),
includes VSS power rails, and emits builder-internal pseudo-names like
`UNKNOWN_PIN`. On one tile probe (`A_0_tile16`): 514 distinct owners in
the tile vs 605 in a naive bbox query (92 false-positive INST-port
owners + 1 missing builder-only owner), and per-owner cuboid counts
diverge in both directions (centroid containment alone is too narrow,
overlap-only is too wide).

V4-A schema v5 requires replicating the exact build_dataset.py clipping
rule. Recorded as deferred — V3 is a far bigger nova ROI lever than V4.

### Round 2.2b — V3 batched GPU (FAILED 2026-05-13)

Wired `--v3-gpu` through `pex_cold.py` with three progressively more
clever implementations; none beat the 16-worker CPU baseline on either
design:

| variant | tv80s V3 wall | tv80s pipeline | nova V3 (rate) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| CPU 16-worker (Round 1) | 16.5 s | 78 s | 24-30 nets/s |
| GPU single-net, fresh transfer | 27.0 s | 71 s | 10 nets/s, ETA 3 h |
| + persistent `_V3_ALL_CUBS` on GPU, gather by `cand_idx` | 26.6 s | 71 s | not run |
| + greedy memory-budget batched broadcast | 28.4 s | 75 s | 6 nets/s, ETA 5.5 h |

`pex_cold.py:_v3_compute_closest_batched_gpu` pads each batch to
`(B, max_t, max_c)` and runs one fused broadcast. The dispatch
amortizes only when nets in a batch have *similar* size. Sorting by
`-len(target_arr)` doesn't help because `N_c` (candidate count from
the spatial query) varies independently — clock spines blow up `max_c`
to ~120 K and the memory budget forces batches down to B ≈ 4 with
30 × padding waste.

Root cause: per-net spatial-query / owner-filter / V3-A subsample
already costs ~5 ms in pure Python, and the GPU broadcast for typical
nets is sub-millisecond. There is no inherent compute deficit to claim
back; GPU pays a constant launch overhead per *batch*, which only
helps if hundreds of nets share `(max_t, max_c)`.

Workable next iterations recorded for future sessions:

* **Bucket-by-size batching**: explicit small/medium/large buckets,
  bucket-specific (max_t, max_c) bounds. Top-K large nets bypass
  batching and run individually on GPU; tiny nets batch B ≈ 1024.
* **Hybrid fork-Pool + spawn GPU sidecar**: keep CPU multi-proc for
  the long tail, route top-K nets to a single spawn-based GPU
  subprocess. Round 1 CPU is already strong on the bulk; GPU is only
  needed for the few nets where compute > overhead.
* **Drop V3 GPU entirely, focus elsewhere**: nova V3 4870 s really
  needs an algorithmic change (Numba/Cython kernel or a fundamentally
  cheaper closest-pair-with-bbox-edge algorithm), not a tensor lift.

### Locked Round 2 conclusion (2026-05-13 end of session)

The reproducible win on tv80s is:
* **Round 1 (V3-A=512 + V3-C + adaptive chunksize)**: pipeline 169 → 78 s.
* **+ V4-A schema v4 cache**: pipeline 78 → 58 s (tv80s only — nova
  blocked by ~200 GB cuboid array and ~600 GB RAM-during-build).

On nova, **only Round 1 is committed** (8059 → 7182 s, 11 %).
Round 2.1 (V4-A) and Round 2.2 (V3 GPU) prototypes are in tree but
gated off — each needs the next-iteration redesigns above before they
beat CPU multi-proc on nova scale.

### Round 3 — V3 algorithmic redesign (IN PROGRESS 2026-05-13)

After Round 2 ruled out GPU dispatch as a profitable per-net escalation
(per-net + batched both regress on nova), the only remaining ROI lever
is to replace the **algorithm**, not the device. Per-target-cuboid
SpatialGrid query + inline per-aggressor closest-pair reduction. The
global (N_t × N_c) numpy broadcast inside `_v3_compute_closest_cpu`
materializes a (512 × 120 k) ≈ 480 MB transient on nova long-tail nets,
so memory bandwidth (not arithmetic) is the actual bottleneck. Per-target
queries return ~40 truly local candidates per target cuboid, avoiding
the broadcast entirely.

Codex+Gemini round 1 (parallel reviewers) converged on **hybrid threshold
gate**: per-target path for long-tail nets, legacy numpy broadcast for
tiny nets where Python loop overhead dominates.

**Implementation (`pex_cold.py:_v3_aggregate_per_target`)**:
- Per-target-cuboid grid query against the GLOBAL SpatialGrid (already
  built once per design — zero per-net build cost).
- `sub_idx.sort()` after own-net filter so candidate ordering is
  deterministic (legacy's `set` iteration order is impl-defined; sort
  removes that as a confounder).
- Strict `<` aggregator update for per-aggressor closest pair —
  preserves first-encountered-wins tie rule.
- Gate: `_V3_PER_TARGET_PAIR_THRESHOLD = 10_000_000` (post-V3-A pair
  count). `_V3_PER_TARGET_MODE = "auto" | "per_target" | "legacy"` via
  `--v3-algo` CLI flag.
- Edges output shape (per-aggressor dict → sorted by overlap → top-768
  capped) matches legacy exactly.

**Validation (tv80s, single-process dump, 120 nets)**:

| Feature class | Bit-exact | R² ≥ 0.99 | MAE_pct |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| V4 H3 (26-D, kernel unchanged) | 26/26 | – | 0.000 |
| V3 scalar (sums, layer_hist, compact_gnd, vss_*) | 31/41 | – | 0.000 |
| V3 closest-pair (broadside/lateral_total, compact_cpl) | 0/3 | 3/3 ✅ | 1.3–3.8 % |
| V3 closest-pair (spacing percentiles, n_edges_*) | 0/6 | 3/6 ⚠️ | 2.2–98.5 % |
| V3 closest-pair (overlap_p95) | 0/1 | 1/1 | 111 % * |

\* `broadside_overlap_p95_um2` has MAE_pct = 111 % only because the
mean is sub-micron² (~5e-3); R² = 0.995 confirms the per-net values
themselves are tight.

The 6 features below R² ≥ 0.99 (`spacing_p25, p50, p95`, `n_edges_lt_1um,
1_to_3um, 3_to_4um`) drift because of float-equal tie-breaks for the
chosen (t*, c*) pair. Probe on `CTS_2`: legacy & per-target agree on
**768 aggressors, 0 distance mismatches**, but broadside/lateral differ
when multiple (t, c) pairs hit the exact same minimum distance — the
chosen pair's overlap region depends on iteration order.

**tv80s pipeline outcome (single-design wall, full pipeline)**:

| Run | V3 / V4 wall | pipeline | MAPE_tot | MAPE_gnd | MAPE_cpl | R²_tot |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Round 1 + V4-A (legacy) | 12.76 / 37.79 s | 58.5 s | 5.097 % | 17.62 % | 13.86 % | 0.9923 |
| + Round 3 per_target (auto) | 17.67 / 38.11 s | 62.7 s | 5.098 % | 17.80 % | 14.01 % | 0.9919 |

MAPE gates **all pass**: tot −0.01 pp, gnd +0.17 pp ✅, cpl +0.13 pp ✅,
R² −0.0004. On tv80s the new V3 is **slower** (17.7 vs 12.8 s) — the
~10 nets that hit the 10 M-pair threshold pay ~500 ms per-target overhead
versus legacy's ~250 ms broadcast. tv80s is not the target design; the
threshold may need to bump to 30-50 M to keep tv80s on legacy entirely.
nova is where the win must show up.

**nova full-pipeline outcome (LOCKED 2026-05-14)**:

| R²_tot | 0.9865 | 0.9862 | −0.0003 ✅ |

V3 rate trajectory tracked from 21 → 41 nets/s as top-tail nets cleared
(top-tail is where per_target wins; mid-tail falls back to legacy at the
10 M-pair gate). V4 rate trajectory similar shape (5/s in CTS spines →
250+/s in mid-tail); V4 path unchanged.

**Pipeline scoreboard end-of-Round-3**:

⚠ tv80s slightly regresses (12.8 → 17.7 s V3) — the threshold should
bump to 30-50 M pairs so tv80s falls back to legacy entirely. Doesn't
affect nova win. Filed as Round 4 #14.

### Round 4 — Numba JIT kernel (LOCKED 2026-05-14)

After Round 3 landed the per-target algorithm at the Python-loop floor,
Round 4 swaps the per-target body for an `@njit`-compiled kernel + a
CSR-encoded dense bin grid + int32 owner IDs. The kernel runs on every
net (no threshold gate), replacing both the per_target path and the
legacy numpy broadcast.

Codex round-1 deliberation flagged the highest-risk item: string-keyed
`all_owner` must be re-encoded as int32 owner IDs before njit can
touch it. Resolution: `_v3_build_owner_id_map()` builds the int32
column + forward/reverse dicts once per design. Decisions:

| Decision | Codex rec | Adopted |
|---|---|---|
| Aggregator | `numba.typed.Dict[int32, UniTuple(float64,5)]` | ✅ |
| Grid encoding | 2D dense CSR (`bin_offsets[nx*ny+1]` + `bin_indices[total_entries]`) | ✅ |
| Precision | float64 throughout | ✅ |
| Math flags | `fastmath=False` (preserve Round 3 tie semantics) | ✅ |
| Threshold | Apply njit unconditionally (drop the 30 M gate) | ✅ |
| Failure mode | string→int32 mapping required upfront | covered |

**Implementation**:
- `pex_cold.py:_v3_aggregate_per_target_njit()` Python wrapper.
- `pex_cold.py:_v3_get_njit_kernel()` lazy-compile + cache via
  `@njit(cache=True, fastmath=False, boundscheck=False)`.
- `_v3_build_dense_grid()` builder (Python triple-loop for clarity;
  nova builds in 6.7 s = 5.9 M entries).
- `_v3_build_owner_id_map()` owner str → int32 (nova: 22 902 unique
  owners on tv80s, 22.5 M unique on nova).
- Fork-Pool `init_worker_v3(..., v3_njit_state=...)` plumbs CSR + owner
  id arrays as fork-shared globals; child workers re-use the parent's
  `@njit(cache=True)` on-disk compiled artifact (compile-once across
  pool — `_v3_per_net` first invocation in a worker triggers a smoke
  call before the imap_unordered loop, so per-worker startup is bound
  by the cached-load cost ~50 ms, not full ~2.3 s recompile).

**Validation (tv80s, full pipeline)**:

| Metric | Round 3 (auto / legacy) | Round 4 (njit) |
|---|---:|---:|
| pipeline | 57.3 s | **48.2 s** (−16 %) |
| V3 wall | 11.5 s | **3.46 s** (3.3 ×) |
| MAPE_tot | 5.079 % | 5.122 % (+0.043 pp ✅) |
| MAPE_gnd | 17.62 % | 17.91 % (+0.29 pp ✅, gate ±0.3 pp) |
| MAPE_cpl | 13.85 % | 13.82 % (−0.03 pp ✅) |
| R²_tot | 0.9923 | 0.9920 (−0.0003 ✅) |

Single-process dump: V3 30.9 s → 3.0 s (**10.18 × single-thread**).
CTS_2 probe: per_target 820 ms → njit warm **79 ms (10.3 ×)**.

Worst feature drift (njit vs legacy on tv80s 120-net dump):
`n_edges_3_to_4um` R² = 0.76, MAE_pct 15 %. Same float-tie tie-break
pattern as Round 3 — kernel visits candidates in bin order, numpy
per_target sorts by index, both produce the same per-aggressor min
distance (`spacing_min_um` bit-exact). Downstream MAPE absorbs it.

The Round-4 V3 trajectory holds at 50 nets/s (vs Round 3's 40 nets/s
mid-tail asymptote) — the modest 1.24 × gain over Round 3 reflects that
most of nova V3 wall lives in the *mid-tail* (Round 3's legacy path),
not the long-tail (Round 3's per_target path). njit replaces both, but
the legacy mid-tail was already cache-efficient.

V4 environmental +140 s (path unchanged) — probably first-touch cache
state difference; no algorithmic regression.

¹ After threshold 30 M tuned to keep tv80s on legacy.

Compound win vs pre-patch baseline (Round 0): **nova 8,059 → 4,906 s
= 1.64 × end-to-end**, **V3 alone 5,607 → 2,352 s = 2.38 ×**.

### Round 5 — optional ceiling pushes (only if Round 4 leaves headroom)

17. **D-pred** (XGBoost GPU predict) — quick free win, ~3 s on nova.
18. **V4 njit kernel** — V4 H3 top-K aggregator is still pure numpy
    per-net (~50 ms/net mid-tail). Numba-fy similarly.
19. **DEF-A** (cache parsed DEF) for re-run workflow.
20. Global sparse adjacency + `scatter_add` (more aggressive B).
21. **Multi-design parallelism (designs share IO + DEF parse)** —
    cross-design fork-Pool may halve overall wall on multi-design runs.

## 6. Acceptance criteria

For Round 1 to be considered done:

* `pex_cold.py` produces the same 67-D feature parquet shape on tv80s + nova.
* Re-running `pex_cold_predict.py --model treepex` gives:
  * tv80s MAPE_tot_med ∈ [4.85, 5.30] % (current 5.105)
  * nova  MAPE_tot_med ∈ [5.30, 5.75] % (current 5.538)
  * tv80s **MAPE_cpl_med within +0.3 pp** of current; same for nova
  * tv80s **MAPE_gnd_med within +0.3 pp** of current; same for nova
  * R²_tot ≥ 0.985 on both; R²_cpl ≥ current −0.005 on both
* Wall time (16 worker fork-Pool, gpu-8) on idle host:
  * tv80s ≤ 30 s shared feature build
  * nova ≤ 1,800 s shared feature build
* `summarize_cold_results.py` output committed alongside the change.
* Profiling note from Round 0 attached.

For Round 2 to be considered done:

* Same MAPE bounds as Round 1.
* `<design>_cuboids.pt` asset committed to the dataset-build pipeline;
  build time + disk size documented per design.
* Wall time on a single A6000 (no other GPU process):
  * tv80s ≤ 8 s shared feature build
  * nova ≤ 200 s shared feature build
* End-to-end determinism preserved (per-net stable seed, no
  non-deterministic CUDA ops in the broadcast path).

## 7. Out of scope

* Mesh-PINN inference speed-up (separate task: port to GPU).
* SPEF write speed-up (already < 4 s on nova).
* Multi-design parallel run optimization: cold tv80s + nova ran in
  parallel previously (3.5 h wall vs serial 3.7 h) — diminishing returns
  on a 64-core host already saturated.
* DEF parser C++ binding (DEF-B): low ROI vs Round 2 ceiling.

> Tile-cache build cost (`build_dataset.py`) is **now in scope** as
> Round 2 G is essentially a tile-cache rebuild with a new schema.
